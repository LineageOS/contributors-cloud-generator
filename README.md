# LineageOS contributors cloud generator

To build the jar, run the following:

    cd source/
    mvn package
    cp target/contributors-cloud-generator-1.0.jar ../lib/

If you make changes in `source/`, this will need to be re-built

To generate the code, open a linux console and type:

    ./generate_wordcloud.py

This will fetch all LineageOS repos (around 110Gb), parse the commits
logs, mix the data and generate a cloud.zip in the output
folder. This will take look long time the first time.

The file resources/well-known-accounts.txt was left willfully empty. The
format of this file should match the name of the account and the list
of known emails for the account

This project is based in a modified version of the
[kumo](https://github.com/kennycason/kumo) library.
